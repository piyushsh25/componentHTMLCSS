    <h1>    SQL vs no-SQL: The similarities and the dis-similarities</h1>
<small>1st Dec 2021</small><br/><br/>
<p>
Both of them are databases used to store data and are used in the backend.SQL stands for Structured Query language, while no-SQL stands for “not only Structured Query language”, </p> 
<p>SQL has been used in the industry for many years while no-SQL is pretty new. An example of SQL is Mysql. Example of no-SQL is MongoDB and Redis</p>
<p>There are many articles online saying which one of them is the best . We will try to understand the key differences between the two and try to understand their main differences. </p>
<p>SQL- is structured meaning for every data there must be a structure pre-defined. It is highly inflexible. For example, a customer wants the bill in an alternate number which is not defined before.It will assign null for the remaining customers, while NO-SQL is un-structured i.e. if an alternate number is added, it will do so without affecting other records. It is flexible in nature.</p>

<p>SQL  is alternately known as relational database i.e. it is related to different tables with the same meaning, NoSQL: Non-relational: They are JSON objects which may not be efficient or fast comparably with relationships like SQL.</p>
<p>SQL, data is stored vertically. SQL runs on table structure.NoSQL, it organises its data into smaller JSON objects. The data gets distributed horizontally. NoSQL runs on the data structure.</p>
<p>So which one is better: They have their own negatives. If there are a lot of relationships SQL is preferred, because of table structure SQL might be bulky. No-SQL is light because the data is distributed horizontally, but it is not good at relationships.</p>
