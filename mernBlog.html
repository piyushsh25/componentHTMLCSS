    <h1>The mysterious MERN- what do they mean? </h1>
    <small>1st Dec 2021</small><br/><br/>
<p>MERN stands for MongoDB, ExpressJS, React, NodeJS </p>
<p>MongoDB is a non-relational database. Which help us store data in collections. It has no pre-defined schema like SQL, It is connected in the back-end along with node and express.</p>
<p>React is a browser-side JavaScript open-source library, it is maintained by Facebook, which allows us to build interactive user interfaces. It is responsible for the fronted and the user experience i.e., how the interface reacts when some action is taken. It is used in interaction with the other three technologies in the backend.</p>
<p>NodeJS is a server-side Runtime JavaScript on the server-side. We can send requests and interact with databases. It is used with express.</p>
<p>Express is a nodeJS framework it makes the functionality very easy, we can make requests through functions and include routing while making requests get, post put, patch, delete </p>
<p>React is the front end technology used, while MongoDB, ExpressJS and NodeJS is back-end. i.e server side. All the logic, authentication are applied in the backend.  We write the program separately for the frontend and backend. They communicate when we send requests from the front-end to the back-end. </p>
<p>The benefit of the MERN stack is we need only JavaScript for the entire app</p>
